Note:

In order for the js and style changes work need to modify the "Featured Product" section at view _DSG_Responsive_Homepage_Template.cshtml
You can find the view at: Views\PageHandlerHome folder.

I have created already the html for it you just need to grab that section from _DSG_Responsive_Homepage_Template_slick.cshtml at the same directory.

Note: Do not compy the entire file as other people may have added changes, only the code from the "Featured Product" section is needed.
